DeckOps automates the installation of iw4x, CoD4x, IW3SP-MOD, and Plutonium on Steam Deck. Pick your games, hit install, and launch them straight from Steam like any other game.

---

## 💾 Installation & Uninstall

1. Press the Steam button → **Power** → **Switch to Desktop**

2. Download the **[DeckOps file](https://github.com/GalvarinoDev/DeckOps/releases/download/v1/DeckOps.desktop.download)** from this page

3. Right-click the file → **Properties** → **Permissions** → tick **"Is executable"** → OK

4. Double-click it
   - **First time:** DeckOps installs automatically
   - **Already installed:** A menu appears - choose to Launch, Reinstall, or Uninstall

> Your Steam games are never touched. Only the files DeckOps created are removed during uninstall.

---

## Requirements

- Steam Deck running SteamOS
- Each game installed through Steam and launched at least once in both SP and MP modes before running DeckOps
- Plutonium games require a free account at [plutonium.pw](https://plutonium.pw)

> Skipping the first-launch step is the #1 cause of install failures. It creates the Proton prefix and starts shader cache downloads.

## How It Works

DeckOps is a setup and management tool, not a launcher. Once your games are set up, launch them directly from Steam's Game Mode. Open DeckOps whenever you want to update a client, reinstall after a Steam update, add a new game, or re-apply controller templates.

For CoD4 and World at War, DeckOps creates separate non-Steam shortcuts for multiplayer modes with their own artwork and controller profiles. The original Steam games default to singleplayer.

## 🎮 Supported Games

DeckOps installs four controller templates into Steam during setup - two gyro layouts (Hold or Toggle) and two additional layouts for games that need them. Steam Input is enabled automatically for every supported game. You can re-apply templates anytime from **DeckOps → Settings**.

| Game | Client | Deck Model | Modes | Controller | Aim Assist | Gyro |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Modern Warfare 1 - Campaign | IW3SP-MOD | LCD + OLED | SP | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Modern Warfare 1 - Multiplayer | CoD4x | LCD + OLED | MP | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Modern Warfare 2 - Campaign | via Steam | LCD + OLED | SP | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Modern Warfare 2 - Multiplayer | iw4x | LCD + OLED | MP | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Modern Warfare 3 - Campaign | via Steam | LCD + OLED | SP | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Modern Warfare 3 - Multiplayer | Plutonium | OLED only | MP | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| World at War | Plutonium | OLED only | SP / MP / ZM | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Black Ops | Plutonium | OLED only | SP / MP / ZM | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Black Ops II - Campaign | via Steam | LCD + OLED | SP | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Black Ops II - Multiplayer & Zombies | Plutonium | OLED only | MP / ZM | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

> A legitimate Steam copy of each game is required. DeckOps does not provide or distribute game files.

> Gyro is implemented via Steam Input and works on all titles regardless of native client support.
