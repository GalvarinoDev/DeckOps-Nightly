> Plutonium online servers require an OLED Steam Deck. LCD users can still play offline Campaign and Zombies via [PlutoniumAltLauncher](https://github.com/framilano/PlutoniumAltLauncher).

> All titles support controller and gyro via Steam Input. During setup, choose your gyro style: Hold (R5 held) or Toggle (R5 press). Aim assist is unavailable for MW2 SP, MW3 SP, and BO2 SP. BO2 gyro may feel slightly different as its dedicated controller layout does not support dual input.

> ¹ Not yet implemented, will be added once the developer confirms it is ready to ship.

## ⚠️ Before You Install
Before running DeckOps, launch each game through Steam in every mode that includes a named client shown in the table above. This creates the Proton prefix and starts shader cache downloads. Skipping this is the most common cause of install failures.

Plutonium games require a free account at [plutonium.pw](https://plutonium.pw).

## ⚠️ After Installation

**DeckOps will switch you to Game Mode automatically.** The transition may take a moment, do not turn off your Steam Deck. Launch every modded game at least once before using Steam in Desktop Mode, or Steam Cloud will overwrite your setup. If asked about cloud saves choose **Keep Local**. If asked about launching in safe mode or changing your settings due to a hardware change choose **No**.

- **MW1 & WaW:** Steam will ask which mode to launch on first run. Select Singleplayer or Campaign and set it as your default. Multiplayer for these games launches via the DeckOps shortcuts in your library instead.
- **MW1 SP (IW3SP-MOD):** On first launch, the game will ask you to select a profile. Choose **Player**, this is the profile DeckOps created with your display settings. Creating a new profile will use default settings instead.
- **MW1 MP** requires two Steam launches to finish setup, then runs normally on the third.
- **BO2 SP** display settings must be set manually in-game. MP and ZM are configured automatically.
- The latest GE-Proton is downloaded and set automatically for all games.
- XACT audio is installed automatically via Protontricks for WaW, BO1 SP, and BO1 MP. Protontricks will be downloaded via Flatpak if not already present.
