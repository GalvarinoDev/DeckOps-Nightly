DeckOps automates the installation of iw4x, CoD4x, IW3SP-MOD, and Plutonium on Steam Deck. Pick your games, hit install, and launch them straight from Steam like any other game.

---

## 💾 Installation & Uninstall

1. Press the Steam button -> **Power** -> **Switch to Desktop**

2. Open a browser and navigate to this GitHub page

3. Download the **[DeckOps file](https://github.com/GalvarinoDev/DeckOps/releases/download/v1/DeckOps.desktop.download)**

4. Right-click the file -> **Properties** -> **Permissions** -> tick **"Is executable"** -> OK

5. Double-click it
   - **First time:** DeckOps installs automatically
   - **Already installed:** A menu appears - choose to Launch, Reinstall, or Uninstall

> Keep the DeckOps file on your Deck. Double-clicking it is how you launch, reinstall, or uninstall DeckOps in the future.

> Your Steam games are never touched. Only the files DeckOps created are removed during uninstall.

## 📋 Requirements

- Each supported game must be **installed through Steam and launched at least once** in the correct modes before running DeckOps - see the table below. DeckOps will show which games aren't ready and prevent you from selecting them.
- Plutonium games require a free account at [plutonium.pw](https://plutonium.pw)

## ⚠️ Before You Install

**Each game must be launched through Steam in the correct modes before running DeckOps.** This creates the Proton prefix and starts shader cache downloads. Skipping this step is the most common cause of install failures.

| Game | Launch these modes in Steam first |
|---|---|
| Call of Duty 4 | Multiplayer **and** Singleplayer |
| Modern Warfare 2 | Multiplayer |
| Modern Warfare 3 | Multiplayer |
| World at War | Campaign **and** Multiplayer |
| Black Ops | Campaign **and** Multiplayer |
| Black Ops II | Multiplayer **and** Zombies |

## ⚠️ After Installation

**If Steam asks about cloud saves, choose Keep Local.** DeckOps writes display and controller configs locally - choosing Upload or letting Steam overwrite will undo them.

**When launching Modern Warfare 1 or World at War for the first time after DeckOps install, Steam will ask which mode you want to launch.** Select Singleplayer or Campaign and set it as your default. Multiplayer for these games launches via the DeckOps shortcuts in your library instead.

**Black Ops II config files are encrypted and cannot be written by DeckOps.** Set your resolution and display settings in-game after launching for the first time.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Modern Warfare 1 Multiplayer won't launch or crashes on first run?**
This is normal - it needs to be launched three times through Steam to finish setup. Launch it once, let it close, launch it again, let it close, then on the third launch it will work.

**Game is showing the wrong resolution, display settings, or shortcuts not using GE-Proton?**
Go to **Settings -> Repair Shortcuts** to re-apply GE-Proton, controller configs, and optimal display settings for each game.

**Controller profiles not working?**
Go to **Settings -> Re-apply Controller Profiles** to reinstall controller templates.

**Game asks for Safe Mode or to override config?**
Choose **No** - DeckOps has already configured optimal settings.

**Cloud save out of sync?**
Choose **Keep Local** to preserve DeckOps settings.
