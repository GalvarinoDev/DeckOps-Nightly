DeckOps automates the installation of iw4x, CoD4x, IW3SP-MOD, and Plutonium on Steam Deck. Pick your games, hit install, and launch them straight from Steam like any other game.

> **Black Ops II MP and Zombies** use a dedicated controller layout that does not support dual input - gyro feel may differ from other titles.

> **Steam Deck LCD:** Plutonium online servers require OLED. For offline Campaign and Zombies on LCD, see [PlutoniumAltLauncher](https://github.com/framilano/PlutoniumAltLauncher).

## ⚠️ Before You Install

Plutonium games require a free account at [plutonium.pw](https://plutonium.pw). Each game must also be launched through Steam in the correct modes before running DeckOps. This creates the Proton prefix and starts shader cache downloads. Skipping this is the most common cause of install failures.

---

## ⚠️ After Installation

**Steam will launch automatically - ignore it and return to Game Mode.** Do not open Steam in Desktop Mode until every modded game has been launched at least once in Game Mode, or Steam Cloud will overwrite your setup.

If asked about cloud saves choose **Keep Local**. If asked about Safe Mode choose **No**.

- **MW1 MP** requires two Steam launches to finish setup, then runs normally on the third.
- **BO2** display settings must be set manually in-game. MP and Zombies configs are written automatically - Singleplayer is encrypted and cannot be set by DeckOps.
