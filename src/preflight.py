preflight.py - checks worth running before a long install starts

Disk space was only ever checked inside the depot downgrade, after
Steam had already been killed and the install was underway. These run
first, while backing out is still free.

Only sizes the codebase already knows are checked: the depot downgrade
headroom, the IW4x DLC pack and the Zombies Declassified pack. There is
deliberately no estimate for the clients themselves. Guessing a number
and then refusing to install based on it is worse than not checking.
