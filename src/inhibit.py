"""
inhibit.py - keep the device awake during long operations

Installs can run for hours and a Deck that suspends mid-install leaves
a half-written prefix behind. Two locks are taken because they cover
different things: logind blocks suspend and idle actions (the one that
matters in Game Mode), and org.freedesktop.ScreenSaver blocks the KDE
screen locker in Desktop Mode.

Both are best effort. A missing binary, bus or service is never fatal.
