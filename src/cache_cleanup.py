cache_cleanup.py — DeckOps LCD shader cache nuke + game launcher

Removes the entire shader cache directory for a game's appid before
launching through Heroic. LCD Plutonium games route through
cache_cleanup.py → flatpak → Heroic → Proton, so Steam's shader cache
for these appids only records activity from the Python/flatpak launcher
process — not the actual game. The cache is useless junk that
accumulates on every launch due to a Steam bug with non-Steam games.

See: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/issues/10486

Called from Steam launch options (Steam-owned games) or non-Steam shortcut
LaunchOptions (own games). Not used on OLED — OLED launches through
Steam's Proton directly and its shader cache is actually useful.

Usage:
    python3 cache_cleanup.py <game_key> <source>

    game_key  — Plutonium game key (t4sp, t4mp, t5sp, t5mp, t6mp, t6zm, iw5mp)
    source    — "steam" or "own"

Steam source adds LD_PRELOAD to work around Steam's pinned libcurl
conflicting with the system flatpak binary.
